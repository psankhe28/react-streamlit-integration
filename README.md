# Interactive Distribution Visualization

This application enables users to explore and interact with two distinct probability distributions: Normal and Binomial. Users have the flexibility to adjust parameters such as mean and standard deviation for the Normal distribution, as well as the number of trials and probability of success for the Binomial distribution. By leveraging Streamlit in conjunction with React, users can dynamically modify parameters and instantly observe the resulting changes in react application too.
